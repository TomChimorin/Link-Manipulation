This specifically allows users to add either class = "external" or target = "_blank". 

### Link Behaviour Attributes

#### ```class = "external"```
The class="external" attribute is used to identify external links in this project. It allows us to apply specific styles or behaviors to those links. In this project, external links are often styled differently to visually indicate they lead to resources outside the site.

#### ```target = "_blank"```
The target="_blank" attribute is used in anchor (<a>) tags to specify that the linked resource should open in a new tab or window. This ensures that when users click on a link, they stay on the current page while being directed to the external link in a separate tab. It's commonly used for external links to keep the user experience smooth, allowing users to explore other resources without leaving the current page.
